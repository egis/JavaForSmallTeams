is This?\nWho is This For?\nStructure\nVersion\nHistory\nA word on Trade-Offs\nA note on Java Versions\nLicense\nAuthor\nCover\n\n\n\nWhat is This?\nThis book is an attempt to capture what \"good\" Java code looks like and the practices that help produce it.\nThis is a problematic document to write.\nThere is no one right answer to what good code looks like and there are many well-respected books that serve the same purpose such as Effective Java, Clean Code and others.\nSo why this document?\nIt differentiates itself by being :\n\nFreely distributable\nOpen for update - contributions, corrections and updates are encouraged\nBrief - much is left out in an attempt to be easily digestible\nNarrow - it captures one opinion of \"good\" appropriate for a specific context\n\nThis last point is important.\nWe assume a number of things about you and the environment you are working in.\n\nWe assume you are writing server side Java in small teams.\nWe assume your teams are of mixed experience (some experts, some beginners).\nWe assume you are writing code in a general \"business\" context.\nWe assume you expect the code to still be in use in five years' time.\n\nSome of the suggestions may be valid in other contexts, others might constitute terrible advice for those contexts.\nIt is also just one opinion from many valid alternatives. To be useful it needs to be an opinion that you can agree with and sign up to. If you disagree with something in this book please make your own thoughts known so it can be improved.\nFinally, not all the code we work on is perfect. Sometimes we inherit our own mistakes, sometimes we inherit other people's.\nThe point of this document is not to say that all code must look like this but to have an agreed destination that we are aiming for.\nWho is This For?\nThis document is intended for consumption by anyone involved with writing server side Java code. From developers writing Java for the first time through to seasoned technical leads serving multiple teams.\nSome sections will be more relevant to some audiences than others but we encourage everyone to at least skim all sections even if you do not read them in depth.\nStructure\nThe document is split into five sections:\n\nProcess - Discussion on development philosophy and workflow\nStyle - Good style and design at a high level\nSpecifics - More specific advice on Java language features and gotchas\nGood tests - How to write good tests\nBad advice - Discussion of some commonly circulated bad advice and patterns\n\nVersion\nThis book is updated often. The latest changes to the book can be viewed online at gitbook.com.\nVersioned releases are available for free from the book's website.\nIf you are reading a PDF or print copy of this book the release version will be displayed on the inside cover. If there is no inside cover then you are reading an unreleased version of the book.\nHistory\nMost of the content of this book began life as internal wiki pages at NCR Edinburgh. We started to convert the wiki into this book at the end of 2015 so that it could be easily shared with other parts of our company.\nRather than keep this as an internal document we decided to open it up to everyone in the hope that together we could make it better.\nA word on Trade-Offs\nThere are no right answers in software engineering.\nIt is a balancing act in which we must trade off one concern against another and make a judgement call about which balance is better for the specific scenario we have found ourselves in.\nOne of the most common mistakes we've seen experienced programmers make is to blindly consider only one or two concerns (often the ones with catchy acronyms) without thought for others.\nWe've carefully set out the context in which we think the advice in this book will be useful, but the context is still very broad. Slightly different situations might benefit from very different trade offs. What worked well for you in one project might not work so well in the next.\nFor this reason we rarely use words like always or never.\nWhen we do use them we have thought carefully before doing so, but what we really mean is almost-always or almost-never.\nHaving said this if you find yourself discounting any of the recommendations in this book please stop and think first. Don't fall into the trap of thinking certain advice cannot apply to you. We often make our worst mistakes when we believe we are being elegant or clever. The full horror of our ineptitude sometimes does not become apparent for months or years.\nAdvice is here to save us from ourselves.\nA note on Java Versions\nThis document is intended to apply to Java 7 and 8, but will be largely applicable to Java 5 and 6.\nWhere there are differences between Java 8 and 7 we will point them out. If you are unlucky enough to be working with an earlier version of Java you will have to discover any differences to Java 7 on your own.\nLicense\nThis work is Copyright © NCR, but may be read and shared with others under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Share Alike licence v4.0.\nAuthor\nThis document was written by Henry Coles and numerous contributors.\nContributors\n\nFrancesco Burato\nGary Duprex\nGrant Forrester\nKevin Grant\nKeir Lawson\nMarco Di Paola\nGordon Rogers\nHerve Saint-Amand\nEwan Summers\nMoshe Immerman\n\nCover\nThe cover was produced by Peter Berry based on a wood engraving of a Long billed curlew from the 1885 text \"Nouveau dictionnaire encyclopédique universel illustré\"\nTo our knowledge Long Billed Curlews are not especially proficient in Java.\n"},"process.html":{"url":"process.html","title":"Process","keywords":"","body":"Process\nCode (good and bad) doesn't just appear from nowhere, someone needs to sit down and write it.

The sooner you find out something is wrong the easier it is to fix.\nWorking on a legacy project, where the only way to discover if a code change is good is to deploy it to a dev/test/qa environment, is frustrating and demoralizing.\nMake sure your project has a well designed development workflow - the effort of setting this up will be repaid many times over.\nIdeally all feedback would be instantaneous, but in practice it is either impractical or impossible to get all feedback this way.\nInstead software development is organized as nested levels of feedback, as shown here:\n\n"},"process/200_instant_feedback.html":{"url":"process/200_instant_feedback.html","title":"Instant Feedback","keywords":"","body":"Instant Feedback\nA modern IDE such as Eclipse or IntelliJ will provide instant feedback as you type, using the underlying compiler and configurable static analysis tools.\nYou can increase the amount of instant feedback you receive by making good use of the Java type system and configuring the static analysis tools.\nWhile feedback from the IDE is fast and convenient, it has some drawbacks.\n\nIt may differ from machine to machine depending on the IDE configuration\nIt is often non binary (i.e. not pass/fail)\nIt can be ignored / overlooked\nThe expectation of speed limits what it can achieve\n\nFor these reasons you should avoid purely IDE centric work flows.

This will usually include a repeat of your instant feedback.\nLocally Runnable Tests\nAfter the compiler and static analysis, the next fastest levels of feedback are the test suites.\nAt least two suites should be maintained that are runnable locally on any developer machine.\nBecause they are typically run immediately after compiling or before committing/pushing code, Martin Fowler refers to these as:\n\nThe compile suite\nThe commit suite\n\nIn Maven, these map naturally to the test and integration-test phases.\nThe criteria for a test being placed in the compile suite should, however, be more than just its execution speed.\nThey must be fast (milliseconds or less per test) but must also be highly deterministic and repeatable. This ensures that the suite provides clean feedback - the only reason that a test should fail after a code change is if the change has caused regression.\nAlthough this sounds simple, in practice it requires considerable rigor to ensure that tests cannot interfere with each other or be affected by external factors.\nTests in the commit suite may be slower and may also be slightly less repeatable. They should aim to be 100% repeatable but they may do things that carry the risk of occasionally causing a failure, like use network IO or write to disk.\nAlthough many tests in this suite may do no more than launch code within the same JVM as the tests themselves, some of the tests should also launch the built artifact (war, ear, jar) and perform at least some degree of testing against it.\nAlthough the commit suite will likely depend on external resources such as containers, databases, queues, etc., it should still be runnable on any machine with a single command.\nInstalling and starting dependent resources should be handled automatically by the build scripts and tests - your project should not come with a page of notes on how to set up a development machine.\nCommonly, the Maven Cargo plugin is used to download and configure containers for testing.\n"},"process/400_slower_feedback.html":{"url":"process/400_slower_feedback.html","title":"Slower Feedback","keywords":"","body":"Slower Feedback\nBoth the compile suite and the commit suite should be run on a CI server, normally triggered by a commit/push to the repository.\nIn addition to the compile and commit suites, other suites should be created.\nThese suites may require resources not available on a local machine and/or take large amounts of time to execute.\nThey may also re-run the same tests against more realistic dependencies. If an in-memory database is normally used when running integration tests locally, the same tests might be run again against a production database.\nFor a Maven build, these suites are likely to be implemented using profiles or as separate Maven modules.\nThese suites will be run as frequently as possible. Most likely, this will mean on a timed basis because it is likely they will consume too much time to be run on commit. Here, \"too much time\" is defined as taking longer than the likely interval between commits/pushes to the monitored repository.\nTimed test runs also sometimes run the suites when no code changes have occurred - this can provide useful information when identifying flaky tests.\n"},"process/600_agree_the_language_you_use_for_tests.html":{"url":"process/600_agree_the_language_you_use_for_tests.html","title":"Agree The Language You Use For Tests","keywords":"","body":"Agree the Language You Use When Discussing Tests\nThe Testing Pyramid\nUnfortunately, the language of testing is heavily overloaded, with different communities referring to different things by the same names.\nThe testing pyramid is a widely recognized diagram of how testing should be approached.\nIt shows large numbers of unit tests at the bottom, with a smaller number of integration tests above them and a yet smaller number of system tests at the peak. Often, some clouds of manual testing are added at the top.\n\nThis diagram has probably been drawn thousands of times. Although unit tests will appear at the bottom of each version, the words used at the other levels will vary wildly.\nEven when the same words are used the meanings attached to them might be different.\nAlthough people might nod when you discuss \"unit tests\", \"integration tests\", \"system tests\", \"end 2 end tests\", \"service tests\", there is no guarantee that they are thinking of the same thing as you.\nDepending on who you speak to, a \"unit test\" might be anything from a word document full of instructions, \"any test written by a programmer\", through to various formal (but by no means authoritative) definitions that appeared in text books.\nThe number of possible meanings of \"integration test\" is even greater.\nUnit Tests\nA fairly tight definition of unit tests is now in common use in the Java community. We recommend that you and your team use this definition.\nTo be a unit test, a test must be:\n\nFast (milliseconds or less)\nIsolated (test only one unit)\nRepeatable (able to be run millions of times on any machine with the same result)\nSelf verifying (either passes or fails)\nTimely (written first)\n\nNote: Although writing your tests first is often a very good idea, a test that meets the other criteria is still a unit test regardless of when it was written.\nWhen we talk about \"unit\" testing, what constitutes a unit isn't necessarily that obvious.\nA somewhat circular definition is that a unit is the smallest thing that makes sense to test independently.\nIt will often be a single class, but this is not necessarily the case. It may make sense to treat a group of classes as a unit (particularly if most of them are non-public) or occasionally even a method.\nIf we accept that a unit is a small thing, and that we'll know it when we see it, then we can see that the criteria for being a unit test largely matches the criteria we put forward for the compile suite.\nThe only difference is that the compile suite does not care about isolation.\nIf we choose to write a test that tests two (or more) units in tandem, it still belongs in the compile suite if it meets the other criteria.\n\nSystem Tests\nSystem tests are also fairly well-defined. They are tests that exercise the overall system - i.e all your code and all the code it interacts with in a realistic environment.\n\nIntegration Tests\nIntegration tests are harder to define. They occupy the large space of everything that doesn't fit the unit or system tests definitions.\nThe two following diagrams show how this terminology fits into our world of test suites.\nThis document will use the terminology unit test, Integration test and System test as shown in these diagrams.\nFor clarity, it will sometimes state exactly what is being tested when discussing integration tests - e.g \"test via the REST API of the war file running in Tomcat\".\nAlthough it is tedious, this long-hand terminology is clear. It is recommended that you use it when discussing testing across teams. Within your own team it is likely you will develop a shorter language you all understand.\n\nThis maps to our suites as shown below:\n\n"},"process/700_use_coverage_as_a_tool_not_a_target.html":{"url":"process/700_use_coverage_as_a_tool_not_a_target.html","title":"Use Coverage As A Tool Not A Target","keywords":"","body":"Use Coverage as a Tool, not a Target\nCode coverage is a useful tool for catching your mistakes.\nThe tool should work for you; you do not work for the tool.\nIt is most useful when code coverage is run at the point at which the code and tests are being written, rather than on a CI server hours later.\nGaps in code coverage highlight areas of code that have not been tested. Some of these gaps may be expected and intentional, others may be a surprise. It is these surprise gaps that provide useful information.\nThis is all that code coverage does.\nCode that has 100% branch coverage may or may not have been tested. Code coverage tells you that some tests have executed the code, not that they have meaningfully tested it. Don't let it lull you into a false sense of security.\nSome teams set coverage targets that code must meet (75% seems to be a common figure). Although well-intentioned, this practice is often damaging.\nCode coverage is easy to measure. Other properties of tests that are desirable (or highly undesirable) are not easy to measure e.g.:\n\nIs the test meaningful?\nIs the test easy to read and understand?\nIs the test tightly tied to a particular implementation?\n\nThis last point is particularly important.\nFor a test to be of value, it must enable refactoring; tests that are tied to one particular way of solving the problem often have negative value because they must be modified or rewritten whenever the code is changed. Unfortunately, it is easy to write tests in this way for a number of months or years before you realize you were doing it wrong.\nBy concentrating on the one property that is easy to measure, the others are de-emphasized. But, much worse than this, trying to meet a coverage target can actively push developers towards writing tests that are tied to the implementation. Bad tests are easier to write than good tests.\nIt is probably fair to say that there is a problem when code has only 30% unit test coverage. On the other hand, if coverage is achieved by setting a target, code with 80% coverage may be harder to work with than code with a lower figure.\nSo don't set targets, instead make sure your team is committed to writing good tests.\nA good test is one which helps explains the code, catches regression and doesn't get in the way when changes are made. Writing the tests before the code can help encourage good tests and will ensure that code has high coverage.\n"},"style.html":{"url":"style.html","title":"Style","keywords":"","body":"Style\nThere are many aspects to programming style, from the mundane questions of where to place braces and new lines through to the more interesting questions of how you design and structure your code.\nThis section looks at all of these aspects, starting with the more abstract concerns before drilling down to the more concrete.\nAlthough static analysis tools can measure aspects of many of the things discussed in most cases they cannot make break-the-build decisions about whether the code is good.

None of them is the single definition always makes sense to follow.\nRecognizing simple isn't easy and keeping things simple takes a lot of work.\nIf we could somehow measure the complexity of our software, we would find that there is some minimum value that each piece of software must contain.\nIf the software were any simpler, then it would be less functional.\nReal programs will always contain this inherent complexity plus a bit. This extra complexity is the accidental complexity we have added because we are less than perfect.\nTelling accidental complexity apart from inherent complexity is of course also hard.\nFortunately YAGNI gives us some useful advice on how to keep things simple without having to tell accidental and inherent complexity apart.\nThe more a system does, the higher its overall complexity will be. If we make a system that does less, it will be simpler - it will have less inherent complexity and less accidental complexity\nYour goal is, therefore, to create the minimum amount of functionality that solves the problems you have right now.\n\nDon't implement things because you think you might need them later. Implement in the future if you need it.\nDon't try and make things \"flexible\" or \"configurable\". Make them do just what they need to do - parameterize them at the point you have a need to do so.\n\nIf you create more than the minimum amount of functionality, you will have more code to debug, understand and maintain from that point forward until someone has the confidence to delete it.\n"},"style/002_prefer_reversible_decisions.html":{"url":"style/002_prefer_reversible_decisions.html","title":"Prefer Reversible Decisions","keywords":"","body":"Prefer Reversible Decisions\nSummary\nPrefer design decisions that will be easy to change.\nDetails\nMany of the decisions you make while designing your code will eventually turn out to be wrong.\nIf you can make your decisions reversible by containing their consequences and adding abstractions then this future change will not matter.\nFor example - if you introduce a third party library and reference it throughout your code, then you have made high the cost of reversing the decision to use that library. If you constrain it to a single location and create an interface for it, the cost of reversing the decision is low.\nBut don't forget KISS and YAGNI - if your abstractions complicate the design then it is better to leave them out.\n"},"style/010_use_a_consistent_code_layout.html":{"url":"style/010_use_a_consistent_code_layout.html","title":"Use A Consistent Code Layout","keywords":"","body":"Use a Consistent Code Layout Within Each Project\nSummary\nAgree and enforce a standard code formatting scheme within each codebase.\nDetail\nThe way in which Java code is formatted and laid out is largely a matter of personal preference.\nSome styles (such as omitting braces in conditional statements) can arguably make certain types of bug slightly more likely.\nOthers might require more work to keep the code compliant (such as aligning fields into columns) but, to a first approximation, no particular scheme is greatly superior to any other.\nDespite this, programmers tend to have strong opinions on the matter.\nEvery codebase should, however, have a single agreed formatting style which is consistently applied and is understood by everyone working on that codebase.\nThis prevents commit wars in which different team members re-format things to their personal preference. It also makes code easier to understand as there is a cognitive cost for the reader if formatting changes radically from file to file.\nAlthough there is value in consistency, there is also a cost.\nUnless there is already broad agreement across teams about how things should be formatted, trying to enforce one official set of rules is likely to create more ill will than benefit.\nA global preferred reference should therefore be set, but teams should be free to deviate from this as they see fit as long as a consistent style is used for the code they maintain.\nFormatting Rules\nIf your do not have your own strong preferences we suggest you follow the Google Java Style.\nThese formatting rules are well thought out, clearly documented and not overly prescriptive.\nWe will not describe them in any detail here, but code formatted to these rules will look something like the following :-\nimport org.slf4j.Logger;\nimport org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;\nimport com.egis.utils.ValidationUtils;\n\n// classes should never be final\npublic class Foo {\n\n    public static final String BAR = \"bar\";\n\n    private static final Logger log = Logger.getLogger(Foo.class);\n\n    // use generified interfaces whenever possible, they make code much more readable\n    private List bars = new ArrayList<>();\n\n    // methods should never be final, it can cause very ugly hacks\n    public void foo(String bar) {\n        // validation go up front\n        Validations.notNull(bar, \"Must specify bar\");\n\n        // put early returns up front\n        if (BAR.equals(bar)) {\n            // make .equals calls null safe by placing the known value first\n            // conditional statements ALWAYS get braces\n            return;\n        }\n\n        bars.add(bar);\n\n        for (String s : bars) {\n            System.out.prontln(s);\n        }\n\n        try {\n            for (int i = 0; i \nData Transfer Object (DTO) Rules\npublic class Person {\n    // combining multiple logical fields in a multiple declaration is ok\n    public String firstName, lastName;\n\n    public Person firstName(String firstName) {\n        this.firstName = firstName;\n        return this;\n    }\n\n    public Person lastName(String lastName) {\n        this.lastName = lastName;\n        return this;\n    }\n    public Person name(String first, String last) {\n        this.firstName = first;\n        this.lastName = last;\n        return this;\n    }\n\n    public String getName() {\n        return firstName + \" \" + lastName;\n    }\n}\n\nSee Bad Advice/Use Getters and Setters\nHowever, we suggest that the guidance in the Google guide on when to write Javadoc is ignored in favor of our own.\nNaming Rules\nHow variables, methods and classes are named plays a big role in how readable it is:\n\nKeep package name and paths short if only for making command line and GitHub navigation easier\nKeep variable names to below 30, DO NOT USE Hungarian notation\nDo not use Abbreviations or Acronyms except for the few globally accepted: i, j, doc, prop, util, exec\nKeep method parameters count low, and avoid boolean parameters. Use a DTO when necessary\n\nCommit Style\nCoding style extends to commit messages:\n\nCommit Format: :  -  e.g. fix: PPT-001 - updated x todo y.\n  Issue types can be one of:\nfix\nfeat\nchore\ndocs\nrefactor\n\n\nCommit all files for a change in a single commit.\nCommit one change at a time.\nCommit refactorings on their own.\n\nNotable Points About This Style\nSpaces not Tabs\nTabs may appear differently depending on how an editor is configured. This will result in constant reformatting as different programmers adapt the file to their editor settings. Spaces avoid this problem.\nIn some languages (e.g. JavaScript before the rise of code minifiers) tabs have/had an advantage as they reduced the size of the source file compared to using multiple spaces. The increase in size of the source file is of no relevance for Java.\nOne True Brace Style\nThere are various arguments about the supposed advantages of this style, but we suggest its use mainly because it is common in the Java community.\nAlthough simple if else statements can be more concisely written by omitting the braces we suggest that they are always included. This reduces the chance of a statement being placed outside the conditional when this was not the intent.\n"},"style/020_prefer_readable_code_to_comments.html":{"url":"style/020_prefer_readable_code_to_comments.html","title":"Prefer Readable Code To Comments","keywords":"","body":"Prefer Readable Code to Comments\nSummary\nUse comments only to explain what you cannot make the code itself explain.\nIf you are about to write a comment, first think if there is a way you could change the code so that it would be understandable without comments.\nDetails\nFrom Clean Code by Robert C Martin.\n\"Nothing can be quite so helpful as a well-placed comment.

Writes and reads will be close together and there will be a clear order in which this happens.\nFor longer-lived objects, things are more complex.\nIf an object escapes from a method then it may be accessed from more than one location within the code.\nWe must start by assuming that anything that can happen to these objects will. We can only confirm that certain situations do not occur by examining the whole program.\nThe set of things that might happen to an immutable object is far smaller than for a mutable one. By constraining how long lived objects can behave we have made things simpler. There are fewer possibilities that we must consider.\nUnfortunately, it is not always easy to tell from a class definition what the lifecycle of objects of that type will be. Perhaps only short-lived instances will be created. Perhaps only long-lived ones. Perhaps a mixture of the two.\nIf we design immutable classes by default we do not need to worry about this.\nThe Problem With Mutable Objects\nIf we have a very simple class such as Foo\npublic class Foo {\n  private Long id;\n\n  public Long getId() {\n    return id;\n  }\n\n  public void setId(Long id) {\n    this.id = id;\n  }\n\n  @Override\n  public int hashCode() {\n    return Objects.hashCode(id);\n  }\n\n  @Override\n  public boolean equals(Object obj) {\n    if (this == obj)\n      return true;\n    if (obj == null)\n      return false;\n    if (getClass() != obj.getClass())\n      return false;\n    Foo other = (Foo) obj;\n    return Objects.equals(id, other.id);\n  }\n}\n\nWe would need to search our codebase for all usages of it to establish the following :\nIt is Never Accessed from Multiple Threads\nFoo is not thread safe.\nWrites to longs are not atomic and nothing within Foo itself establishes a happens-before relationship between the field write and read.\nIf setId and getId are ever called from different threads we might get back stale or garbage values.\nsetId Is Never Called After Foo Has Been Placed in a Set\nThe hashcode of this class relies on a mutable field. If we modify it after we place it in a set then our program will not behave as we expect.\nThe Flow of Our Data\nEven if our program behaves correctly, we need to do work in order to understand how it functions.\nsetId can be called at any point after the object is created. We can, therefore, only understand how data flows through our program by looking for all calls to setId - perhaps there are several, perhaps there is only one. The only way we can discover this is by examining the entire program.\nImmutable Objects\nIf we can make our objects immutable we gain guarantees that mean we do not need to worry about how our objects are used.\n@Immutable\npublic final class Foo {\n  private final Long id;\n\n  public Foo(Long id) {\n    this.id = id;\n  }\n\n  public Long getId() {\n    return id;\n  }\n\n  @Override\n  public int hashCode() {\n    return Objects.hashCode(id);\n  }\n\n  @Override\n  public boolean equals(Object obj) {\n    if (this == obj)\n      return true;\n    if (obj == null)\n      return false;\n    if (getClass() != obj.getClass())\n      return false;\n    Foo other = (Foo) obj;\n    return Objects.equals(id, other.id);\n  }\n}\n\nIt no longer matters if Foo is long or short lived.\nIt is inherently thread-safe.\nWe know that whatever value we construct it with will remain until it dies. There is only one possible point where data is written so we do not need to search for others.\nAnnotations\nThe example uses the JSR3051 javax.annotation.concurrent.Immutable annotation.\nThis does not in any way change the object's functionality but provides a way to communicate the intent of this being an immutable class. Static analysis tools such as Mutablility Detector can check if this intent has been violated.\nWe can tell at a glance that Foo is immutable as it has final fields of a well known immutable type.\nThe final keyword ensures only that the reference a field points to will not change.\nIf the field were of type Bar then we would not know if it were mutable or not without examining Bar to see if it too were immutable. Even if we were not using a static analysis tool the use of the Immutable annotation would make this assessment faster.\nInstead of updating the state of immutable objects, we create new instances that retain the state we do not wish to modify.\nThis pattern seems strange to some Java programmers at first, but the programming model is similar to how the familiar String class works.\n@Immutable\npublic final class Bar {\n  private int anInt;\n  private String aString;\n\n  public Bar(int anInt, String aString) {\n    this.anInt = anInt;\n    this.aString = aString;\n  }\n\n\n  @CheckReturnValue\n  public Bar withAnInt(int anInt) {\n    return new Bar(anInt, this.aString);\n  }\n\n  @CheckReturnValue\n  public Bar withAString(String aString) {\n    return new Bar(this.antInt, aString);\n  }\n}\n\nInstances of Bar with new values can be obtained by calling withAString and withAnInt.\nThe JSR305 javax.annotation.CheckReturnValue enables static analysis tools such as Error Prone to issue a warning if a mistake is made such as in the code below.\npublic Bar doThings(Bar bar) {\n  if(someLogic()) {\n    bar.withAnInt(42);\n  }\n  return bar;\n}\n\nThe call here to withAnInt achieves nothing because the return value is not stored. Most likely, the programmer intended to write:\npublic Bar doThings(Bar bar) {\n  if(someLogic()) {\n    return bar.withAnInt(42);\n  }\n  return bar;\n}\n\nWhen to Use Mutable Objects\nMutable objects require slightly less boilerplate to create than immutable ones.\nIf you know that a class will only ever be used to create short-lived, local objects then you might consider making it mutable. But you must weigh this against the additional work required to ensure that the class is only ever used in this fashion as the codebase grows.\nOptions exist to auto-generate both immutable and mutable classes, thereby removing mutable objects' main advantage. Two of these options are discussed further in \"Know How to Implement Hashcode and Equals\".\nMutable objects used to be the norm in Java. As a result, many common frameworks require mutable objects. Persistence and serialization frameworks often require Java beans with no args constructors and setters. Other frameworks might require you to use two-stage construction with a lifecycle method such as init.\nIt is not always highlighted in the documentation but some long standing frameworks have been updated to support immutable objects.\nJackson for example now allows constructors and factory methods to be annotated :-\npublic class Foo  {\n  private final int x\n  private final int y;\n\n  @JsonCreator\n  public Foo(@JsonProperty(\"x\") int x, @JsonProperty(\"y\") int y) {\n   this.x = x;\n   this.y = y;\n  }\n}\n\nOther frameworks, such as Hibernate, can only be used with classes that provide a default constructor. Although they can be configured to set fields directly without the need for setters this causes more problems than it solves.\nIf you are tied to a framework that requires mutability then you will need to use mutable objects where you interface with that framework.\n"},"style/051_optimise_for_readability_not_performance.html":{"url":"style/051_optimise_for_readability_not_performance.html","title":"Optimise For Readability Not Performance","keywords":"","body":"Optimize for Readability not Performance\nSummary\nDon't optimize your code prematurely.\nConcentrate on making it simple and understandable instead.\nDetails\nMany new programmers worry about the performance of each method they write, avoid code they expect to be inefficient and write in a style that attempts to minimize object allocations, method calls, assignments or other factors they expect to have a cost.\nAlthough it often decreases readability and increases complexity, most micro-performance optimization provides no performance benefit at all.\nWithin the context in which we work, performance should be one of the concerns considered last. Instead, attention should be paid to making code as simple and readable as possible.\nIf a performance issue arises, profiling should be used to identify where the problems actually lie.\nThis does not mean the performance should be disregarded completely, but it should always be trumped by code readability and simplicity until it can be proven that there is a real benefit to optimization. Where code can be written in a more efficient manner without any increase in complexity or trade-off with readability then the (presumed) more efficient code should be preferred.\n"},"style/052_prefer_composition.html":{"url":"style/052_prefer_composition.html","title":"Prefer Composition","keywords":"","body":"Prefer Composition to Inheritance\nSummary\nComposition usually results in more flexible designs.\nFirst consider using composition, then fall back to using inheritance only when composition does not seem to be a good fit.\nDetails\nComposition means building things by adding other things together. Inheritance is building things by extending behavior based on an existing class by creating a child classes.\nTo take a minimal example- If there is a requirement for a class to accept and store String values, some programmers new to Java will reach for inheritance as follows:\nclass InheritanceAbuse extends ArrayList {\n\n  public void performBusinessLogic(int i) {\n    // do things with stored strings\n  }\n\n}\n\nThe same functionality can be implemented using composition.\nclass UsesComposition {\n\n  private final List values = new ArrayList();\n\n  public void performBusinessLogic(int i) {\n    // do things with stored strings\n  }\n\n  public void add(String value) {\n    this.values.add(value);\n  }\n\n}\n\nDespite requiring more code, an experienced Java programmer would not even consider the first approach. So why is it that the second version is preferable?\nThere are several overlapping explanations, we'll start with the most abstract and move on to more practical ones.\nInheritance is a Strong Relationship\nInheritance is used to model an IS-A relationship - i.e. we are saying that our InheritanceAbuse class is an ArrayList and we should be able to pass one to any piece of code that accepts an ArrayList.\nComposition creates a HAS-A relationship; this is a weaker relationship and we should always favor weaker relationships in our code.\nSo favoring composition over inheritance is just one specific instance of the more general advice to favor weak relationships between our classes.\nUsing inheritance makes sense when there is an IS-A relationship there but it is an inappropriate mechanism to use purely for reusing code.\nInheritance Breaks Encapsulation\nThe inheritance implementation fails to encapsulate an implementation detail - that we're storing things in an ArrayList.\nThe interface to our class includes all sort of methods from ArrayList such as:\n\nclear\nremove\ncontains\n\nDo these methods make sense for our class? If someone calls them, could it interfere with the logic in performBusinessLogic?\nWe don't know enough about what our example class is meant to do to answer these questions definitively, but the answer is most likely that we would prefer not to expose these methods.\nIf we switch from ArrayList to some other list implementation this is visible to the classes clients. Code that previously compiled may now break even if no methods specific to ArrayList are called - the change of type alone might cause compilation failures.\nWe Can Only Do This Once\nJava doesn't support multiple inheritance so we only get to pick one thing to extend. If our class also needed to store Integers then inheritance isn't even an option so we'd have to use composition.\nComposition is inherently more flexible in single inheritance languages.\nComposition Aids Testing\nThis is not relevant to our simple example, but it is trivial to test how classes linked together by composition interact. It is far harder when inheritance is used.\nclass MyUntestableClass extends SomeDependency {\n  public void performBusinessLogic(int i) {\n    // do things using methods from SomeDependency\n  }\n}\n\nclass MyClass {\n  private final SomeDependency dependency;\n\n  MyClass(SomeDependency dependency) {\n    this.dependency = dependency;\n  }\n\n  public void performBusinessLogic(int i) {\n    // do things with dependency\n  }\n}\n\nIt is easy to inject a mock into MyClass. Tricks exist to isolate the code in MyUntestableClass from SomeDependency for the purpose of unit testing, but they are far more involved.\nInheritance is Static\nInheritance sets a fixed relationship between concrete classes at compile time. With composition it is possible to swap in different concrete classes at runtime.\nAgain composition is inherently more flexible.\nInterface Inheritance\nThe advice to prefer composition to inheritance refers to implementation inheritance (i.e. extending a class). The disadvantages discussed  above do not apply to interface inheritance (i.e. implementing an interface).\nIn fact, the design choice you often have to make is between implementation inheritance or a combination of composition and interface inheritance.\nIn these situations, the advice is still to prefer the approach that uses composition.\nFor example, the well known composition based Decorator pattern:\nclass ProcessorUpperCaseDecorator implements Processor {\n\n  private final Processor child;\n\n  ProcessorUpperCaseDecorator(Processor child) {\n    this.child = child;\n  }\n\n  @Override\n  public void process(String someString) {\n    child.process(someString.toUpperCase());\n  }\n\n}\n\nCould also be implemented using inheritance\nclass InheritanceUpperCaseDecorator extends ConcreteProcessor {\n\n  @Override\n  public void process(String someString) {\n    super.process(someString.toUpperCase());\n  }\n\n}\n\nBut, again, this solution would be less flexible.\nWith the composition based version we can decorate any Processor. With the inheritance version we would need to re-implement the decorator for each concrete type to which we wished to add the upper case behavior.\nMany common OO patterns rely on the combination of Composition and interface inheritance.\nWhen to Use Implementation Inheritance\nAlmost anything that can be achieved with implementation inheritance can also be achieved using the combination of interface inheritance and composition.\nSo when should implementation inheritance be used?\nImplementation inheritance has one single advantage over composition - it's less verbose.\nSo implementation inheritance should be used when both of the following conditions are met\n\nThere is an IS-A relationship to be modelled\nThe composition based approach would result in too much boilerplate code\n\nThe 2nd point is unfortunately entirely subjective.\n"},"style/100_consider_code_generators_carefully.html":{"url":"style/100_consider_code_generators_carefully.html","title":"Consider Code Generators Carefully","keywords":"","body":"Summary\n\n\n\nDetails\nBoilerplate Generators\nCompile Time Annotation Processors\nDownsides\nSurprise\nFriction\n\n\nThe Trade-off\n\n\n\n\n\nCode generators can automatically implement certain types of functionality, saving time and eliminating the possibility of certain classes of bugs.\nAlthough they have much to recommend them, code generators also have a cost that should be considered carefully before incorporating them into your project.\nFavor generators that allow a clear separation between generated and non-generated functionality, but make sure you understand the trade-offs you are making before including any generator into your project.\nDetails\nCode generators can be grouped into three general types:\n\nBoilerplate generators\nCompile time annotation processors\nRuntime generators/frameworks\n\nBoilerplate Generators\nBoilerplate generators are the simplest form of code generation. They can be further split into :\n\nGenerators that insert code into existing classes (e.g. methods auto generated by an IDE).\nGenerators that produce scaffolding that is checked into version control and modified.\nGenerators that produce new classes from a model. The generated code is not normally checked into version control.\n\nWe recommend that the first type are using sparingly, if at all. This is discussed further in \"Know How to Implement Hashcode and Equals\".\nGenerating code from a model (such as a schema or grammar) can be a useful approach as long as the generated code is not modified and is packaged separately. If generated and non-generated code are packaged within the same module then this can start to cause friction (see below).\n\nCompile Time Annotation Processors\nJSR 269 introduced a standard framework for processing annotations at build time. Several tools exist that use JSR 269 to generate code.\nMost use the annotated classes purely as input, from which new classes are generated. Often, the new classes extend or implement the annotated class or interface but remain separate. These are really just a subset of model based boilerplate generators where the model input model is annotated Java classes.\nSome (such as project Lombok) update the annotated classes themselves, adding additional behavior. This is likely to increase both surprise and friction which are discussed below.\n\nDownsides\nThere are clearly a lot of upsides to code generators, so why wouldn't they always make sense?\nThe main issues they cause are surprise and friction.\nSurprise\nIf you generate code at compile or runtime the you are no longer programming in Java.\nYou are programming in an augmented Java that does things that developers maintaining the code may not be aware of.\nIt may do things that they do not expect.\nIt may break fundamental assumptions that programmers have about what can or cannot happen within their code.\nRuntime generators will usually generate more surprise than compile time systems - they add an element of magic that breaks the usual Java rules. Runtime generators also often weaken type safety, moving classes of problem a developer would normally expect to occur at compile time to runtime.\nThe first time a developer encounters a code generator in a project, everything it does will be surprising.\nAfter a period of learning, most of the surprise should go away but each developer will need to go through this learning period. The learning involved can be significant - gaining a complete understanding of framework such as Spring is, for example, a significant effort.\nThe most worrying problem is when there is still some surprise left after the initial learning period.\nIf you find yourself asking the question \"could this be because of the code generator?\" when something unexpected happens with your system, and having to eliminate that possibility each time, then you have introduced a very real cost into your project.\nFriction\nCode using compile-time generators will not import cleanly into IDEs unless the IDE understands how to run the generator. Even when the system is supported by an IDE it may require plugins to be installed, configuration options to be set etc.\nThe amount of friction, and how often it is encountered, will depend on the IDE and the quality of the support. There may be little friction and it may only be encountered when a new developer joins a project. Or it may be considerable and triggered each time code is cleaned.\nThe most effective way to reduce the friction is to package the generated code separately from the code that depends upon it. The generated code then becomes a normal binary dependency and the fact that it is automated becomes an internal implementation detail.\nWhile this works well, it may also have a downside. It may create artificial modules. If the code was not auto-generated, would it have made sense to package it as a separate module?\nRuntime generators do not usually introduce much friction, although sometimes issues might be experienced if javaagents are not present when running tests from the IDE.\nThe Trade-off\nSo those are the issues.\nSurprise and friction sound like minor concerns compared to the promise of functionality for free, but their impact can be significant.\nWhether or not it makes sense to introduce a code generator often depends on how much it will be used. If there is a large amount of functionality that can be auto-generated then it probably makes sense, if the amount is relatively small it may be best to stick with vanilla Java.\n"},"style/200_group_methods_for_easy_comprehension.html":{"url":"style/200_group_methods_for_easy_comprehension.html","title":"Group Methods For Easy Comprehension","keywords":"","body":"Group Methods for Easy Comprehension\nSummary\nThe public methods of a class should appear at the top of the file, the private methods towards the bottom and any protected or package default methods in between.\nIn addition to arranging by accessibility, they should also be ordered into a logical flow.\nDetail\nThis scheme tries to achieve two goals:\n\nHighlight the public API by separating it from implementation detail\nAllow the reader to follow the logical flow with the minimal of scrolling\n\nTo achieve the 2nd goal, methods should be arranged into logical groups, with methods always appearing above the ones they call.\nThe two goals clearly conflict because grouping the public API methods together at the top of the file prevents grouping them with the implementation methods that they used.

Again, this is not a hard rule, just a guide of when to feel uncomfortable.\nYour code will naturally contain some methods that are larger than others - some concepts are inherently more complex than others and the implementation will not become simpler if broken down further or expressed in a different way.\nBut most large methods can be made smaller in one of three ways :\n\nRefactoring into a number of smaller methods\nRe-expressing the logic\nUsing appropriate language features\n\nSplitting a Method into Smaller Concerns\nMany large methods have smaller methods within them trying to find a way out.\nWe can make our code easier to maintain by freeing them.\nBad\nprotected static Map getHttpHeaders(HttpServletRequest request) {\n  Map httpHeaders = new HashMap();\n\n  if (request == null || request.getHeaderNames() == null) {\n    return httpHeaders;\n  }\n\n  Enumeration names = request.getHeaderNames();\n\n  while (names.hasMoreElements()) {\n    String name = (String)names.nextElement();\n    String value = request.getHeader(name);\n    httpHeaders.put(name.toLowerCase(), value);\n  }\n\n  return httpHeaders;\n}\n\nBetter\nprotected static Map getHttpHeaders(HttpServletRequest request) {\n  if ( isInValidHeader(request) ) {\n    return Collections.emptyMap();\n  }\n  return extractHeaders(request);\n}\n\nprivate static boolean isInValidHeader(HttpServletRequest request) {\n  return (request == null || request.getHeaderNames() == null);\n}\n\nprivate static Map extractHeaders(HttpServletRequest request) {\n  Map httpHeaders = new HashMap();\n  for ( String name : Collections.list(request.getHeaderNames()) ) {\n    httpHeaders.put(name.toLowerCase(), request.getHeader(name));\n  }\n  return httpHeaders;\n}\n\n\nRe-expressing logic\nTerrible\npublic boolean isFnardy(String item) {\n  if (item.equals(\"AAA\")) {\n    return true;\n  } else if (item.equals(\"ABA\")) {\n    return true;\n  } else if (item.equals(\"CC\")) {\n    return true;\n  } else if (item.equals(\"FWR\")) {\n    return true;\n  } else {\n    return false;\n  }\n}\n\n\nThis can be easily re-expressed with less noise as :\nBetter\npublic boolean isFnardy(String item) {\n  return item.equals(\"AAA\")\n      || item.equals(\"ABA\")\n      || item.equals(\"CC\")\n      || item.equals(\"FWR\");\n}\n\nOr with a move to a more declarative style :\nprivate final static Set FNARDY_STRINGS\n  = ImmutableSet.of(\"AAA\",\n                    \"ABA\",\n                    \"CC\",\n                    \"FWR\");\n\npublic boolean isFnardy(String item) {\n  return FNARDY_STRINGS.contains(item);\n}\n\nNeither of the above changes alter the structure of our program or even affect the signature of the method. Both still reduce both line count and complexity while increasing readability.\nSimplifying things with a series of higher impact changes that extract a model of our domain is, however, often the best approach.\nIt is difficult to guess what this model might look like for our contrived example, but is likely that this conditional logic could be replaced with polymorphism.\nenum ADomainConcept {\n  AAA(true),\n  ABA(true),\n  CC(true),\n  FWR(true),\n  OTHER(false),\n  ANDANOTHER(false);\n\n  private final boolean isFnardy;\n  private ADomainConcept(boolean isFnardy) {\n    this.isFnardy = isFnardy;\n  }\n\n  boolean  isFnardy() {\n    return isFnardy;\n  }\n}\n\nUsing Appropriate Language Features\nMethods are sometimes bloated by boilerplate that solves common programming problems. The need for some of this boilerplate has been removed by new language features.\nSome of these new features aren't all that new, but code is still written without them:\n\nJava 5 Generics removes the need for ugly casts\nThe Java 5 for-each-loop can replace code using iterators and indexed loops\nThe Java 7 try-with-resources can replace complex try, catch finally blocks\nThe Java 7 multi-catch can replace repeated catch blocks\nJava 8 lambda expressions can replace anonymous class boilerplate\n\n"},"style/400_methods_should_do_one_thing.html":{"url":"style/400_methods_should_do_one_thing.html","title":"Methods Should Do One Thing","keywords":"","body":"Methods Should Do Only One Thing\nSummary\nMethods should do only one thing.\nDetails\nA useful guide as to whether a function is doing only one thing is given in \"Clean Code\" by Robert C Martin.\n\"another way to know that a function is doing more than “one thing” is if you can extract another function from it with a name that is not merely a restatement of its implementation.\"\nBad\n  public void updateFooStatusAndRepository(Foo foo) {\n     if ( foo.hasFjord() ) {\n        this.repository(foo.getIdentifier(), this.collaborator.calculate(foo));\n     }\n\n     if (importantBusinessLogic()) {\n       foo.setStatus(FNAGLED);\n       this.collaborator.collectFnagledState(foo);\n     }\n  }\n\nBetter\n  public void registerFoo(Foo foo) {\n     handleFjords(foo);\n     updateFnagledState(foo);\n  }\n\n  private void handleFjords(Foo foo) {\n      if ( foo.hasFjord() ) {\n        this.repository(foo.getIdentifier(), this.collaborator.calculate(foo));\n     }\n  }\n\n  private void updateFnagledState(Foo foo) {\n    if (importantBusinessLogic()) {\n       foo.setStatus(FNAGLED);\n       this.collaborator.collectFnagledState(foo);\n     }\n  }\n\nYou've gone too far\n  public void registerFoo(Foo foo) {\n     handleFjords(foo);\n     updateFnagledState(foo);\n  }\n\n  private void handleFjords(Foo foo) {\n      if ( foo.hasFjord() ) {\n        this.repository(foo.getIdentifier(), this.collaborator.calculate(foo));\n     }\n  }\n\n  private void updateFnagledState(Foo foo) {\n    if (importantBusinessLogic()) {\n       updateFooStatus(foo);\n       this.collaborator.collectFnagledState(foo);\n     }\n  }\n\n  private void updateFooStatus(Foo foo) {\n    foo.setStatus(FNAGLED);\n  }\n\n"},"style/600_avoid_null.html":{"url":"style/600_avoid_null.html","title":"Avoid Null","keywords":"","body":"Avoid Null Whenever Possible\nSummary\nNull is a billion dollar mistake, make sure you know how to avoid using it in your code.\nTry to limit the times you or your clients need to write the following:\n  if ( != null ) {\n    ...\n  }\n\nDetails\nAlthough it is likely that libraries and frameworks you interact with will return null, you should try to ensure that this practice is isolated to third party code.\nThe core of your application should assume that it does not have to worry about null values.\nStrategies to avoid null include :\n\nThe null object pattern - when you have something you think is optional\nThe type-safe null pattern (aka Option, Optional & Maybe) - when you need to express that an interface might not return something\nDesign by contract\n\nThe Null Object Pattern\nThe null object pattern is the classic OO approach to avoiding null. You should use it whenever you think you have a dependency that you think is optional.\nThe pattern is very simple, just provide an implementation of the interface that does \"nothing\" or has a neutral behavior. This can then be safely referenced by its clients, with no need to check for null.\nType-Safe Nulls (aka Optional)\nThe type-safe null pattern is familiar in most functional programming languages where it is variously known as Maybe, Option or Optional. Java 8 finally adds an Optional type, but implementations are available for earlier versions via Guava and other libraries.\nIt is a simple pattern. An Optional is basically just a box that can hold either one or zero values. You can check if the box is empty (using isPresent) and retrieve its value via a get method.\nOptional should be used whenever a public method might not return a value as part of normal program flow.\nIf you call get on an empty Optional, it will throw a NoSuchElementException.\nIt might not be immediately obvious what value Optional provides over just using null. If you need to check that an Optional has something in it before calling get, how is this different from checking a value is not null to avoid a NullPointerException?\nThere are several important differences.\nFirstly, if your method declares that it returns Optional then you can instantly see from the type signature that it might not return a value. If it only returned Person you would only know that it might return null if you looked at the source, tests or documentation.\nEqually important, if you know that you always return Optional within your codebase when something might not be present, then you know at a glance that a method returning Person will always return a value and will never return null.\nFinally, the preferred way to use Optionals is not to call the get method or to explicitly check if it contains a value. Instead the values that are contained (or not contained) in an Optional can be safely  mapped, consumed and filtered by various method on the class.\nIn the simplest case a possibly empty Optional can be accessed by calling the orElse method which takes a default value to use if the Optional is empty.\nAs mentioned, the sweet spot for using Optionals is for the return types for methods. They should not generally be held as fields (use the null object pattern here instead) or passed to public methods (instead provide overloaded versions that do not require the parameter).\nOne objection that is sometimes raised by Java programmers encountering Optional for the first time is that it is possible for an Optional to be null itself. While this is true, returning a null Optional from a method is a perverse thing to do and should be considered a coding error.\nStatic analysis rules exists that can check for code that returns null Optionals.\nDesign by Contract\nWe wish for all code that we control to be able to ignore the existence of null (unless it interfaces with some third party code that forces us to consider it).\nObjects.requireNonNull can be used to add a runtime assertion that null has not been passed to a method.\nBecause your core code should generally assume that null will never be passed around, there is little value in documenting this behavior with tests; assertions add value because they ensure that an error occurs close to the point where the mistake was made.\nWe can also check this contract at build time.\nJSR-305 provides annotations that can be used to declare where null is acceptable.\nAlthough JSR-305 is dormant, and shows no signs of being incorporated into Java in the near future, the annotations are available at the maven co-ordinates :-\n\n    com.google.code.findbugs\n    jsr305\n    3.0.1\n\n\nThey are supported by several static analysis tools including :-\n\nFindbugs\nError Prone\n\nThese can be configured to break the build when null is passed as a parameter where we do not expect it.\nAnnotating every class, method or parameter with @Nonnull would quickly become tedious and it would be debatable whether the gain would be worth the amount of noise this would generate.\nFortunately, it is possible to make @Nonnull the default by annotating a package in its package-info.java file as follows\n@javax.annotation.ParametersAreNonnullByDefault\npackage com.example.somepackage ;\n\nSadly, sub-packages do not inherit their parent's annotations, so a package-info.java file must be created for each package.\nOnce non null parameters have been made the default behavior, any parameters that do accept null can be annotated with @Nullable.\n"},"style/601_keep_it_solid.html":{"url":"style/601_keep_it_solid.html","title":"Keep It Solid","keywords":"","body":"Keep It SOLID\nSummary\nThe SOLID acronym provides some guidance on design that you should follow.\n\nSingle Responsibility Principle\nOpen Closed Principle\nLiskov Substitution Principle\nInterface Segregation Principle\nDependency Inversion Principle\n\nDetails\nSingle Responsibility Principle\nSeparate your concerns - a class should do one logical thing and one thing only.

Do not implement them unless it is necessary to do so. If you do implement them, make sure you know what you are doing.\nDetails\nIt is well known that if you override equals then you must also override the hashCode method (see Effective Java item 9).\nIf logically-equal objects do not have the same hashCode they will behave in a surprising manner if placed in a hash based collection such as HashMap.\nBy \"surprising\", we mean your program will behave incorrectly in a fashion that is very difficult to debug.\nUnfortunately, implementing equals is surprisingly hard to do correctly. Effective Java item 8 spends about 12 pages discussing the topic.\nThe contract for equals is handily stated in the Javadoc of java.lang.Object. We will not repeat it here or repeat the discussion of what it means, that can be found in Effective Java and large swathes of the internet. Instead we will look at strategies for implementing it.\nWhichever strategy you adopt, it is important that you first write tests for your implementation.\nIt is easy for an equals method to cause hard-to-diagnose bugs if the code changes (e.g. if fields are added or their type changes). Writing tests for equals methods used to be a painful and time-consuming procedure, but libraries now exist that make it trivial to specify the common cases (see Testing FAQs).\nDon't\nThis is the simplest strategy and the one you should adopt by default in the interests of keeping your codebase small.\nMost classes do not need an equals method. Unless your class represents some sort of value it makes little sense to compare it with another so stick with the inherited implementation from Object.\nAn irritating gray area are classes where the production code never has a requirement to compare equality but the test code does. The dilemma here is whether to implement the methods purely for the benefit of the tests or to complicate the test code with custom equality checks.\nThere is, of course, no right answer here; we would suggest first trying the compare-it-in-the test approach before falling back to providing a custom equals method.\nThe custom equality checks can be cleanly shared by implementing a custom assertion using a library such as AssertJ or Hamcrest.\nEffective Java tentatively suggests having your class throw an error if equals is unexpectedly called\n@Override public boolean equals(Object o) {\n  throw new AssertionError(); // Method is never called\n}\n\nThis seems like a good idea but, unfortunately, it will confuse most static analysis tools. On balance, it probably creates more problems than it solves.\nAuto-Generate With an IDE\nMost IDEs provide some method of auto-generating hashCode and equals methods. This is an easily-accessible approach, but the resulting methods are (depending on the IDE and its settings) often ugly and complex such as the ones generated by Eclipse shown below:\n  @Override\n  public int hashCode() {\n    final int prime = 31;\n    int result = 1;\n    result = prime * result + ((field1 == null) ? 0 : field1.hashCode());\n    result = prime * result + ((field2 == null) ? 0 : field2.hashCode());\n    return result;\n  }\n\n  @Override\n  public boolean equals(Object obj) {\n    if (this == obj)\n      return true;\n    if (obj == null)\n      return false;\n    if (getClass() != obj.getClass())\n      return false;\n   MyClass  other = (MyClass) obj;\n    if (field1 == null) {\n      if (other.field1 != null)\n        return false;\n    } else if (!field1.equals(other.field1))\n      return false;\n    if (field2 == null) {\n      if (other.field2 != null)\n        return false;\n    } else if (!field2.equals(other.field2))\n      return false;\n    return true;\n  }\n\nUnless your IDE can be configured to produce clean methods (as discussed below) we do not generally recommend this approach. It is easy for bugs to be introduced into this code by hand editing over time.\nHand Roll Clean Methods\nJava 7 introduced the java.util.Objects class that makes implementing hashCode trivial. Guava provides the similar com.google.common.base.Objects class which may be used with earlier versions of Java.\n  @Override\n  public int hashCode() {\n    return Objects.hash(field1, field2);\n  }\n\nThe Objects class also simplifies implementing equals a little by pushing most null checks into the Objects.equals method.\n  @Override\n  public boolean equals(Object obj) {\n    if (this == obj) // \nThe first if statement is not logically required and could be safely omitted; it may, however, provide performance benefits.\nUsually, we would recommend that such micro-optimizations are not included unless they have been proven to provide a benefit. In the case of equals methods, we suggest that the optimization is left in place. It is likely to justify itself in at least some of your classes and there is value in having all methods follow an identical template.\nThe example above uses getClass to check that objects are of the same type. An alternative is to use instanceof as follows\n  @Override\n  public boolean equals(Object obj) {\n    if (this == obj)\n      return true;\n    if (obj == null)\n      return false;\n    if (!(obj instanceof MyClass)) // \nThis results in a behavioral difference - comparing instances of MyClass with its subclasses will return true with instanceof but false with getClass.\nIn Effective Java Josh Bloch argues in favor of instanceof as the getClass implementation violates a strict interpretation of the Liskov substitution principle.\nHowever, if instanceof is used, it is easy for the symmetric property of the equals contract to be violated if a subclass overrides equals. i.e.:\nMyClass a = new MyClass();\nExtendsMyClassWithCustomEqual b = new ExtendsMyClassWithCustomEqual();\n\na.equals(b) // true\nb.equals(a) // false, a violation of symmetry\n\nIf you find yourself in a situation where you need to consider the nuances of whether subclasses are equal to their parents then we strongly suggest you reconsider your design.\nHaving to think about maintaining the equals contract in a class hierarchy is painful and you shouldn't need to put yourself, or your team, through this for normal server-side coding tasks.\nIn the majority of cases, if you think it makes sense for your class to implement hashCode and equals, we strongly suggest you make your class final so hierarchies do not need to be considered.\nIf you believe you have a case where it makes sense for subclasses to be treated as equivalent to their parent, use instanceof but ensure that the parent equals method is made final.\nAvoid relationships that are more complex than this.\nCommons EqualsBuilder and HashCodeBuilder\nThe Apache commons hashcode and equals builders were once a popular way of generating these methods. We do not recommend their use in new code as most of what they achieved is now provided by java.util.Objects without bringing in a 3rd party library, or by the Guava equivalent.\nThese classes do provide the option of a single line reflection based implementation.\npublic boolean equals(Object obj) {\n  return EqualsBuilder.reflectionEquals(this, obj);\n}\n\npublic int hashCode() {\n  return HashCodeBuilder.reflectionHashCode(this);\n}\n\nThe brevity of these implementations is attractive, but their performance is measurably poorer than others discussed so far. Good performance tests and regular profiling can help determine whether a poorly performing method genuinely leads to performance bottlenecks in your application. If you are confident that you would detect such adverse impacts then using these methods as initial placeholder implementations may be a reasonable approach. But in general we suggest you avoid them.\nCode Generators\nA number of projects exist that can auto-generate value objects at build-time. Two of the better known options are :\n\nGoogle auto\nProject Lombok\n\nBut many others are available.\nGoogle Auto\nGoogle Auto will create a subclass with the obvious implementation of an abstract class annotated with @AutoValue. This implementation will include functioning hashcode and equals methods.\nimport com.google.auto.value.AutoValue;\n\n\n@AutoValue\nabstract class Animal {\n  static Animal create(String name, int numberOfLegs) {\n    return new AutoValue_Animal(name, numberOfLegs);\n  }\n\n  Animal() {}\n\n  abstract String name();\n  abstract int numberOfLegs();\n}\n\nThis is clearly far less effort than hand crafting a complete Animal class, but there are some downsides.\nSome of the issues with code generators are discussed in \"Consider Code Generators Carefully\", which categorized them into friction and surprise.\nHere, Google Auto introduces some friction as the code shown above will not compile within an IDE until the generator has run to produce the AutoValue_Animal class.\nThere is also some surprise.\nBecause it is a value, Animal would normally be implemented as a final class - but we have been forced to make it abstract. The team behind Auto recommend you add a package-private constructor to prevent other child classes being created.\nUnlike normal Java, the order in which accessors are declared is important because it is used by the generator to define the order of the constructor parameters. Re-ordering the accessors can, therefore, have the surprising effect of introducing a bug.\nLombok\nLombok can also (amongst other things) generate full implementations of value objects.\nIt takes a different approach to Google auto.\nGiven an annotated class such as:\n@Value\npublic class ValueExample {\n  String name;\n  @NonFinal int age;\n  double score;\n}\n\nIt will alter the class at build-time to produce an implementation along the lines of:\npublic final class ValueExample {\n  private final String name;\n  private int age;\n  private final double score;\n\n  public ValueExample(String name, int age, double score) {\n    this.name = name;\n    this.age = age;\n    this.score = score;\n   }\n\n  public String getName() {\n    return this.name;\n  }\n\n  public int getAge() {\n    return this.age;\n  }\n\n  public double getScore() {\n    return this.score;\n  }\n\n  public boolean equals(Object o) {\n   // valid implementation of equality based on all fields\n  }\n\n  public int hashCode() {\n   // valid hashcode implementation based on all fields\n  }\n\nWhile Google Value asks the programmer to provide a valid public API for a class, Lombok creates the public API based on a description of its internal state. The description is valid Java syntax but has a different meaning when interpreted by Lombok.\nLombok causes some friction. It is not practical to use Lombok without an IDE that understands it - code using the autogenerated api will appear to be invalid. An IDE plugin must be installed.\nWhile it (arguably) introduces less friction than auto once the IDE plugin is installed, the behavior of Lombok is much more surprising. It is easy to explain what Auto does - it generates a class at build-time that implements an interface you define. It is much harder to predict or explain what Lombok will do.\nAlthough Lombok requires the programmer to write less code than solutions such as Auto, it deviates further from normal Java.\nIf you consider using a code generator for Value classes, we would recommend you consider approaches such as Auto before Lombok.\nTo its credit Lombok does provide an escape route (see \"Prefer reversible decisions\") in the form of delombok which allows you to output the generated classes.

References to generic type List should be parameterized\nSimilarly, for errant code such as:\nList l = new ArrayList();\nList ls = l;\n\nThe compiler will issue:\nThe expression of type List needs unchecked conversion to conform to List\nMake sure that all such warnings are addressed, either by imposing a zero compiler warnings policy or by configuring the compiler to treat them as errors.\nIn this case, removing both the cast and the warning is straight forward:\nList list = numberList();\nfor (Integer each : list) {\n   // do things with each\n}\n\nPoor Design\nSometimes, removing a cast or fixing a warning is non-trivial. We have bumped into issue two - poor design.\nFor example:\nList widgets = getWidgets();\nList results = process(widgets);\n\nfor (Object each : results) {\n  if (each instanceof String) {\n    // handle failure using data from string\n  } else {\n    EnhancedWidget widget = (EnhancedWidget) each;\n    widget.doSomething();\n  }\n}\n\nNormally, objects placed into a collection should be of a single type or of multiple types related by a common superclass or interface.\nHere, unrelated types have been placed into the same list with a String used to communicate some sort of information about how \"processing\" of a widget has failed.\nThe classic OO fix for this code would be to introduce a ProcessResult interface with two concrete implementations.\ninterface ProcessResult {\n void doSomething();\n}\n\nclass Success implements ProcessResult {\n\n  private final EnhancedWidget result;\n\n  @Override\n  public void doSomething() {\n    result.doSomething();\n  }\n\n}\n\nclass Failure implements ProcessResult {\n\n  private final String result;\n\n  @Override\n  public void doSomething() {\n    // do something with result string\n  }\n\n}\n\nThe original code can then be fixed as follows:\nList widgets = getWidgets();\nList results = process(widgets);\n\nfor (ProcessResult each : results) {\n    each.doSomething();\n  }\n}\n\nOr, more concisely in Java 8:\n List results = process(widgets);\n results.stream().forEach(ProcessResult::doSomething);\n\nIt may also sometimes make sense to use a disjoint union type aka Either.\nThis technique can be particularly useful as an interim step when reworking legacy code that uses mixed type raw collections, but can also be a sensible approach when dealing with error conditions.\nUnfortunately, Java does not provide an Either type out of the box but at its simplest it looks something like:\npublic class Either {\n  private final L left;\n  private final R right;\n\n  private Either(L left, R right) {\n    this.left = left;\n    this.right = right;\n  }\n\n  public static  Either left(final L left) {\n    return new Either(left,null);\n  }\n\n  public static  Either right(final R right) {\n    return new Either(null,right);\n  }\n\n  boolean isLeft() {\n    return left != null;\n  }\n\n  L left() {\n    return left;\n  }\n\n  R right() {\n    return right;\n  }\n\n}\n\nLibraries such as Atlassian's Fugue provide implementations with much richer functionality.\nUsing the simplistic form of Either with Java 7 the code could be re-written as:\nList widgets = getWidgets();\nList> results = process(widgets);\n\nfor (Either each : results) {\n  if (each.isLeft()) {\n    // handle failure using data from string\n  } else {\n    each.right().doSomething();\n  }\n}\n\nWhile most Java programmers will prefer the earlier OO version, this version has two advantages:\n\nIt requires no change to the structure of the original code - all we have really done is make the types document what is happening\nIt requires less code\n\nThis pattern can help quickly tame a legacy code base that is difficult to comprehend.\nLimits of the Type System\nSometimes we do reach the limits of Java's type system and need to cast.\nBefore we do this, we must make certain that the cast is safe and there is no better solution to our problem.\nSimilarly, we may need to sometimes suppress a Generics warning, this can be done by annotating with @SuppressWarnings e.g.\n@SuppressWarnings(\"unchecked\")\n T read(final Class type, String xml) {\n  return (T) fromXml(xml);\n}\n\nObject fromXml(final String xml) {\n  return ... // de-serialise from string\n}\n\nHere, the compiler has no way of knowing what type has been serialized to the String. Hopefully the programmer does or else a runtime error will occur.\n"},"specifics/800_do_not_use_magic_numbers.html":{"url":"specifics/800_do_not_use_magic_numbers.html","title":"Do Not Use Magic Numbers","keywords":"","body":"Do Not Use Magic Numbers\nSummary\nMagic numbers should be replaced with well-named constants that describe their meaning.\nDetail\nPlacing numeric or string literals directly into source code causes two problems:\n\nIt is unlikely that the meaning of the literal will be clear\nIf the value changes updates are required where ever the literal has been duplicated\n\nLiterals should therefore be replaced with well-named constants and Enums.\nBad\npublic void fnord(int i) {\n  if (i == 1) {\n    performSideEffect();\n  }\n}\n\nBetter\npublic void fnord(int i) {\n  if (i == VALID) {\n    performSideEffect();\n  }\n}\n\nYou've missed the point\npublic void fnord(int i) {\n  if (i == ONE) {\n    performSideEffect();\n  }\n}\n\nIf the constants you extract relate to an identifiable concept, create an Enum instead:\nGood\npublic void fnord(FnordStatus status) {\n  if (status == FnordStatus.VALID) {\n    performSideEffect();\n  }\n}\n\nSome coding standards make statements such as \"0 and 1 are exceptions to this rule\".

This is usually a premature optimization and increases the opportunity for mistakes as the code will behave differently in development vs production.\nSwitching off assertions in production also greatly dilutes their value.

Some extra work to be performed after the real work is done. A chore.\nThe reason for writing them has become lost.\nWhy Write Tests?\nThe reason to write tests is to make our lives easier.\nIf we are not writing tests that do this we should stop writing them.\nA good test should do all of the following:\n\nEnable refactoring by preventing regression when the implementation changes\nCatch bugs during initial coding\nDocument how the code behaves\nInform the design of the code\n\nWhen tests are viewed as a chore to be completed after the code is written only this first point is considered.\nOften it is not achieved.\nTests written with this mindset can have a negative value:\n\nInstead of enabling refactoring they can increase its cost.\nInstead of documenting what the code does, the tests are harder to understand than the code itself.\nInstead of aiding development they increase the work that must be done\n\nThis first problem causes the most pain.\nIf you have a test that is tied to the code's implementation, to change the way the code is implemented you have to spend effort changing the test.\nIf the test must change whenever the implementation changes then we cannot trust that the test will stop regression. How do we know we did not introduce a bug into the test when we changed it?\nExecutable Specifications\nSo how do we make sure we do not write negative value tests? How do we make sure we write tests that provide the benefits in our list?\nThe first thing to do is let go of the idea that we are testing.\nWe are not testing, we're specifying.\nTo test something you only need to verify that it \"does what it does\". To specify you need to describe the important things that it must do in a way that can be clearly understood.\nA good specification describes only the important things.\nIt describes what something must do without making assumptions about how it will do it. It allows for multiple implementations. If a specification is tied to one implementation then it is over-specified and will have to change when the implementation does.\nSo this is what we must aim for - an executable specification of our code.\nUnfortunately it is very hard to do.\nSpecification First\nOne simple technique that can help is to write the specification before the code. i.e. TDD.\nA rigorous TDD cycle proceeds in very small steps.\nFirst write a test and run it to ensure that it fails.\nNext write just enough code to make that test pass (and no more).\nTake a moment to see if there is a sensible refactoring that would improve the code, then write the next test and continue the cycle.\nThis has several advantages:\n\nIt guarantees that all the code can be tested\nAs there is no implementation when the test is written it is harder to write a test that is tied to one\nIt guarantees that all behavior is covered by tests\nIt discourages writing superfluous code\n\nThere are two important aspects to TDD:\n\nWriting the specification first\nMoving in very small steps\n\nBoth of these practices are a good idea individually, even if they are not combined.\nIf we wrote our specification first, but moved in larger steps (possibly because we believed we knew what our implementation should look like) we would realize our first advantage - a guarantee that the code we wrote could be tested.\nWhat do we mean by this?\nIf code is not written with testing in mind then it can be difficult to write a test for it that fits our definition of a unit test.\nWe can make our code more likely to be testable by following simple rules such as:\n\nAlways inject dependencies\nAvoid global state (singletons, static variables, ThreadLocals, registries etc)\n\nBut even if we follow these rules we can still find that it is difficult to test our code if we have not designed for it. Writing our specification first requires our design to consider testing.\nAlthough we ensured our code was testable, because we moved in large steps with an implementation in mind we might not achieve the other benefits.\nIf we were to write our code without first writing a test we might discover we were finished that our code was difficult to test. The process of writing that code would however have been easier if we had applied the second technique - moving in small steps.\nIf we wrote only a small amount of code before executing it and observing the result of each small code change, we would probably spend less time debugging, be less likely to write code we did not need and move faster over all.\nTDD has many advantages but it is not magic.\nEven if it is applied rigorously it is entirely possible to write terrible code and specifications. TDD doesn't mean you can stop thinking.\nDespite this, if you have a good understanding of the technologies and domain in which you are working, TDD is usually the best approach if you wish to optimize for quality.\nIf you do not understand your domain or technology well you may find writing a specification first hard.\nThe classic solution to this problem is to first gain understanding by producing a throw away spike.\nSpikes\nA spike is just some quick and dirty code to explore how you might tackle the problem. At the end of the spike you will know if that approach works well or if it is worth looking for alternative approaches.\nBy producing a spike, you gain more understanding of both the domain and the technology you are working with. Even if the conclusion at the end of the spike is that it was a poor approach, the spike was still useful as it increased your understanding.\nOnce you have learned what you can from the spike, it should be thrown away and the final code test driven using the knowledge you have gained.\nSpike and Stabilize\nTraditionally, spikes are thrown away as they are inherently of low quality. Discarding the spike is done to optimize code quality at the expense of a (probably) slower delivery.\nSometimes this is not the trade-off you want.\nAn alternative is to try to stabilize the spike so that it is fit for use. If you do this, you will usually end up with something of lower quality than if you had started again.\nYou will also end up spending more effort on this piece of code over the lifetime of the project than if you had thrown the spike away.\nWhat you gain for this loss in quality and increase in effort is a faster first delivery. Sometimes this is a trade-off worth making, sometimes it is not.\n"},"tests/200_think_units_not_methods.html":{"url":"tests/200_think_units_not_methods.html","title":"Think Units Not Methods","keywords":"","body":"Think Units, Not Methods\nEach behavior that a unit test describes should normally relate to the overall unit rather than the responsibilities of an individual method.\nWhat is a Unit?\nTo think in terms of units we have to first answer the difficult question of what a unit actually is.\nTesting in terms of methods is effectively the same as saying that a unit is a method. It is easy to show why this does not always work.\nIf we were to try and write a unit test for the push method of java.util.Stack we might end up with something like:\n@Test\npublic void testPush() {\n   Stack testee = new Stack();\n   testee.push(\"foo\");\n   assertThat(testee.pop()).isEqualTo(\"foo\");\n};\n\nNow lets test the pop method:\n@Test\npublic void testPop() {\n   Stack testee = new Stack();\n   testee.push(\"foo\");\n   assertThat(testee.pop()).isEqualTo(\"foo\");\n};\n\nOh.

Each one represents a self contained logical behavior.\nSo sometimes units are as small as methods.\nSometimes they are also larger than a single class.\nIf we were to inherit the code below without any tests what tests might we write for it?\npublic class ThingaMeBob {\n\n  private final Iterable actions;\n\n  ThingaMeBob() {\n    actions = Arrays.asList(new Addition(), new Subtraction());\n  }\n\n  public int process(String s, int a, int b) {\n    for (MatchingBinaryOperator each : actions) {\n      if (each.match(s)) {\n        return each.apply(a,b);\n      }\n    }\n\n    throw new RuntimeException();\n  }\n\n}\n\nclass Addition implements MatchingBinaryOperator {\n  public boolean match(String s) {\n    return \"add\".equals(s);\n  }\n  public int apply(int a, int b) {\n    return a + b;\n  }\n}\n\nclass Subtraction implements MatchingBinaryOperator {\n  public boolean match(String s) {\n    return \"minus\".equals(s);\n  }\n  public int apply(int a, int b) {\n    return a - b;\n  }\n}\n\nWe might write tests for the Addition and Subtraction classes:\npublic class AdditionTest {\n\n  Addition testee = new Addition();\n\n  @Test\n  public void shouldMatchWhenStringIsAdd() {\n  }\n\n  @Test\n  public void shouldNotMatchWhenStringIsNotAdd() {\n  }\n\n  @Test\n  public void shouldAddTwoNumbers() {\n  }\n\n  // etc\n\n}\n\nAnd for the ThingaMeBob class:\npublic class ThingaMeBobTest {\n\n  ThingaMeBob testee = new ThingaMeBob();\n\n  @Test\n  public void shouldAddTwoNumbers() {\n  }\n\n  @Test\n  public void shouldSubtractTwoNumbers() {\n  }\n\n  // etc\n\n}\n\nAt some point we would hopefully question why this code is so over-engineered and consider refactoring to something simpler like.\npublic class ThingaMeBob {\n\n  public int process(String s, int a, int b) {\n    if (\"add\".equals(s)) {\n      return a + b;\n    }\n\n    if (\"minus\".equals(s)) {\n      return a - b;\n    }\n\n    throw new RuntimeException();\n  }\n\n}\n\nWhat happens to our tests?\nWhich ones were most valuable?\nThe answer of course is that the test which exercised all three classes through the public interface of ThingaMeBob proved the most useful. We did not have to change it at all. When it ran green we knew our refactoring was successful and everything still works.\nWe deleted the ones for Addition and Subtraction. The smaller units we created were just implementation detail.\nLets re-wind and imagine things happened differently.\nWhat if we were asked to test drive the desired behavior from scratch? What would we write?\nWe would most likely write something that looked like our 2nd simpler version of ThingaMeBob and a test that looked something like ThingAMeBobTest.\nIf we were then asked to add support for another 10 operations, we might leave our design fundamentally the same.\nWhat if a new requirement came for the behavior in ThingAMeBob to be more dynamic, with different operations being enabled and disabled at runtime?\nIt would then make sense to refactor to something like our earlier more complex version.\nWhat should we do with the tests?\nWe would already have tests written in terms of ThingaMeBob that describe all supported behaviors. Should we also fully describe Addition, Subtraction and the other 10 operations with tests as we extract them into classes?\nThere is no right answer here, but I hope it is clear that the most useful unit that we have identified is ThingaMeBob. The smaller units are part of just one implementation of the functionality we require.\nIf we choose to write tests for each extracted class those tests would have some value.\nThe test written in terms of ThingaMeBob would do a poor job of describing what each of the small extracted units does. If a test was failing it wouldn't be instantly obvious which class the bug was in. If we had to change one of the extracted classes it wouldn't be instantly obvious which test to run.\nSo there is definitely value in writing tests for each of the extracted classes. At the same time, if we were not to do so, that would also be a reasonable decision and it would reduce the cost of the refactoring.\nThe ThingaMeBob tests will be fast and repeatable and allow us to work easily with the code. If we could only have tests at one level, the level we would choose is ThingaMeBob.\nSo, as a starting point, assume that a unit will be a class, but recognize that this is not a hard rule.\nA unit is really a \"single self contained logical concern\" - it may make sense to have several classes collaborate in order to capture that concern - as long as that collaboration provides a single well defined entry point.\nMaking units too small may be a form of over-specifying.\nMaking units too large may result in tests that are difficult to understand and expensive to maintain.\nAs a rule of thumb, if you might reasonably have made one or more classes inner classes of a different class, perhaps they should be treated as a single unit.\n"},"tests/300_name_tests_with_a_specification_style.html":{"url":"tests/300_name_tests_with_a_specification_style.html","title":"Name Tests With A Specification Style","keywords":"","body":"Name Test Cases With a Specification Style\nUse the name of each test case to describe one (and only one) behavior of the unit under test. The name should be a proposition - i.e. a statement that could be true or false.\nThe method name should start with should.\nThis is superfluous once you get good at writing test names, but in a mixed team it is useful as it encourages thinking about the test in the right way.\nThe rest of the name should describe a behavior and, optionally, a scenario (identified by the word When).\nFor example, we might start to describe java.util.Stack with:\n\nshouldBeEmptyWhenCreated\nshouldReturnMostRecentlyAddedItemsFirst\nshouldThrowAnErrorWhenItemsRemovedFromEmptyStack\n\nContrast this with common naming patterns found in some code bases:\n\nemptyStack\ntestEmptyStack\ntestPush\n\nThese names alone tell us nothing about how a Stack should behave.\nIf we omit should we can create more concise names\n\nisEmptyWhenCreated\nreturnsItemsInOrderTheyAreAdded\nthrowsAnErrorWhenItemsRemovedFromEmptyStack\n\nAlthough more verbose the formulaic should form has an advantage - it provides a clear pattern to follow.\nIf a developer knows that a test name must start with should (often because they have seen this pattern within existing tests) it is hard for them to revert to a different style and write a test that is not a proposition.\nThe verbosity of should pays for itself by forcing developers to think about tests in the right fashion.\nKevlin Henney compares shoulds to training wheels on a bike - a device to help while we are learning.\nSo when should we take the training wheels off?\nThis depends on the makeup of the team and how often the team changes.\nIf the majority of people who are likely to work on the codebase over its lifetime are accustomed to writing tests in this style then the added verbosity is not worth it. If a sufficiently large proportion are not then it is probably best for the team to stick with the convention.\nUse the Example Style When Specification Style Does Not Work\nOccasionally, it is not possible to follow the specification naming style because the descriptions become too long and unwieldy. If it feels like your method names are becoming overly long ask yourself two questions:\n\nAm I really testing only one thing?\nIs my unit doing too much?\n\nIf you're confident the answer is \"no\" to both then switch to a different style - example style.\nIn example style the name describes only the \"When\" part. It does not describe the expected behavior, e.g.:\n\nemptyStack\noneItemAdded\nremovalFromEmptyStack\n\nTo understand tests named with the example style, you must read the code within the tests. For this reason, this specification style should be preferred when possible.\nAvoid Method Names in Test Descriptions Where Possible\nWhere possible, avoid including method names in test names.\nOn a practical level this avoids the extra overhead of updating test names if method names are ever refactored.\nMore subtly, including names can make you think in the wrong fashion - verifying method implementation rather than specifying unit behavior.\nThis is not a hard rule - sometimes it will be difficult or impossible to describe a meaningful behavior without referring to the unit's interface.\nThe domain language may also overlap with the method names, so you may find yourself using the same words as are also used as a method name.\n"},"tests/400_pick_examples_carefully.html":{"url":"tests/400_pick_examples_carefully.html","title":"Pick Examples Carefully","keywords":"","body":"Pick Examples Carefully\nTraditional testing is performed with examples.\nThe overall behavior of the component or unit is explained by supplying a series of example input and output values, or example interactions with other components.\nOur goal is to use examples to\n\nCommunicate the general expected behavior\nCommunicate the behavior at any edge cases\nGain confidence that our code is correct and remains correct when we change it\n\nSo how should we pick these examples?\nOne approach is to look at the possible inputs to the component under test.\nWe could fully specify our code if we provided the expected output for each possible input. Usually, this is not practical because the possible range of inputs is far too large. Instead, we can look for categories of values within the possible range of inputs (e.g valid and invalid) and pick an example from each one.\nHowever, the best approach is usually not to think in terms of possible inputs and examples, but to instead think first of the behaviors we would like our code to exhibit.\nOnce we have identified the behavior we can then pick examples that demonstrate it. The actual values used are often unimportant - \"Make tests easy to understand\" discusses some techniques to make unimportant values less prominent in tests and highlight the important ones.\nProperty-based testing takes this a stage further.\nProperties are identified that must hold true for all inputs or for a subset of possible inputs that meet certain criteria. The tests do not contain any example values - just a description of how they must be constrained. The examples used to check the properties are generated randomly and only ever seen if the check fails.\nThere are some compelling advantages to property based testing:\n\nThe tests describe what is important about the input values. In example testing this must be inferred by the reader\nThe tests will automatically find edge cases and bad assumptions made by the programmer\n\nThere is currently little experience with property-based testing in the Java community, so questions remain on how best to use it.\nOne obvious issue is that it introduces randomness, although most frameworks provide some mechanism to control it and repeat test runs.\nFollow the Zero, One and Many Rule\nIf your components deals with numbers or collections of things, make sure you use sufficient examples to describe its behavior.\nA good rule thumb is that test cases covering 0 (or empty), 1 and \"many\" are likely to be necessary. There will also be important edge cases, e.g. algorithmic code dealing with integers might need to consider Integer.MAX and Integer.MIN.\nThe zero, one many rule defines the minimum number of cases you can hope to consider. To properly describe your code's behavior will likely require many more.\nWhen test driving, it is usually easiest to start with the zero test case.\nTest One Thing at a Time\nEach test case should specify one thing and one thing only.\nMultiple assertions within a test may be an indicator that the test is testing more than one thing. Multiple assertions should be treated with suspicion, but are not necessarily a problem e.g.\n  @Test\n  public void shouldReturnItemsInOrderTheyWereAdded() {\n     ArrayDeque testee = new ArrayDeque();\n\n     testee.add(\"foo\");\n     testee.add(\"bar\");\n\n     assertEquals(\"foo\",testee.pop());\n     assertEquals(\"bar\",testee.pop());\n  }\n\nThis test tests only one concern, but uses multiple asserts to do so.\nTest Each Thing Only Once\nOnce you've tested a concern, don't let it leak into other tests - if you do then those tests are no longer testing only one thing.\nThis is a particularly easy mistake to make with interaction-based testing. If it is vitally important that the method anImportantSideEffect is called, it is easy to find yourself verifying that method in each test case.\nIf the contract ever changes so that this side effect is not longer important, all tests will need to be updated.\nThis concern should instead by covered by a single test case shouldPerformImportantSideEffect.\nAlthough we shouldn't let a property leak into test cases where it does not belong this does not necessarily mean that it will be confined to a single test case. It may take several examples to fully demonstrate a property.\n"},"tests/500_make_tests_easy_to_understand.html":{"url":"tests/500_make_tests_easy_to_understand.html","title":"Make Tests Easy To Understand","keywords":"","body":"Make Tests Easy to Understand\nOne of our goals when writing a test is to document what the code under tests does.\nWe achieve this in part by choosing clear specification style names for each test case, but we must also ensure that the code implementing each test case is easy to understand.\nSome techniques that help achieve this are discussed below.\nMake Test Structure Clear\nA test can be viewed as having three parts:\n\nGiven - create the values and objects required for the test\nWhen - executes the code under test\nThen - verifies the output/behavior is as expected\n\nThese stages are also sometimes called arrange, act and assert by people particularly attached to the letter 'a'.\nAlthough it is important that these three stages are visible, trying to rigorously separate them or label them with comments adds noise to a test.\nBad\n  @Test\n  public void shouldRetrieveValuesInOrderTheyAreAdded() {\n\n    // given\n    Stack testee = new Stack();\n    String expectedFirstValue = \"a\";\n    String expectedSecondValue = \"b\";\n\n    // when\n    testee.push(expectedFirstValue);\n    testee.push(expectedSecondValue);\n    String actualFirstValue = testee.pop();\n    String actualSecondValue = testee.pop();\n\n    // then\n    assertThat(actualFirstValue).isEqualTo(secondValue);\n    assertThat(actualSecondValue).isEqualTo(firstValue);\n  }\n\nBetter\n  @Test\n  public void shouldRetrieveValuesInOrderTheyAreAdded() {\n    Stack testee = new Stack();\n    testee.push(\"a\");\n    testee.push(\"b\");\n    assertThat(testee.pop()).isEqualTo(\"b\");\n    assertThat(testee.pop()).isEqualTo(\"a\");\n  }\n\nFollow Standard TEA Naming Convention for Test Variables\nEstablishing simple conventions can make some very basic things about a test clear to a reader.\nIf the unit you are testing is a class make this clear by always naming it testee within a test.\nIf you need to store an expected value in a variable, call it expected (but don't store it in a variable just for the sake of it).\nIf you need to store a result that you will compare against an expected value in variable, name it actual (but don't store it in a variable just for the sake of it).\nIf you have stubbed a participant consider naming it stubbedFoo, if it is acting as a mock name it mockedFoo. This rule is less hard than the others - decide on a case by case basis whether you think it makes your test more or less readable.\nHighlight What is Important, Hide What is Not\nIt should be possible to read each test case at a glance - so make things clear by highlighting what is important for that test case and hiding what is not.\nIf an aspect of the input is important to the test case, highlight it by setting it explicitly in the test case - don't rely on that value being set in a generic setup method.\nEven if the same value is set by default, it is better to re-supply it in the test so it is clearly visible.\nIf a particular value is not important, indicate this to the reader by using well-known neutral values such as \"foo\" for strings, or use clear names such as someInt or anInt for variables and methods that supply values.\nSupplying values via a method call makes them less visible.\nWhat is important in the test below?\nBad\n  @Test\n  public void shouldXXX() {\n    MyClass testee = new MyClass();\n    assertThat(testee.process(0, \"\", 3))\n      .isEqualTo(Status.FAIL);\n  }\n\nHow about this version?\nBetter\n  @Test\n  public void shouldXXX() {\n    int invalidValue = 3;\n    MyClass testee = new MyClass();\n    assertThat(testee.process(anInt(), aString(), invalidValue))\n      .isEqualTo(Status.FAIL);\n  }\n\nWhile we need additional context to understand why 3 is an invalid value, it should be clear that the first two parameters to the process method are not important to the behavior we are specifying.\nWhy is it important that the testee below returns the enum CONTINUE?\nBad\n  @Test\n  public void shouldXXX() {\n    assertThat(testee.process()).isEqualTo(CONTINUE);\n  }\n\nIf we look through the rest of the class we might find:\n  @Before\n  public void setup() {\n     MyClass testee = new MyClass();\n     testee.setDefaultProcessState(CONTINUE);\n  }\n\nOther tests might not need to care about what the default state is, but this test does so we should write:\nBetter\n  @Test\n  public void shouldXXX() {\n    testee.setDefaultProcessState(CONTINUE);\n    assertThat(testee.process()).isEqualTo(CONTINUE);\n  }\n\nAs we start to deal with more complex domain objects, it becomes harder to separate the important values from the ones that are required to construct valid objects but not of particular interest to our test.\nFortunately, we can use the builder pattern to ease the pain, reduce duplication, and keep the tests readable.\nName Values Meaningfully\nIf a value has an important meaning, make that meaning clear e.g.:\n  Foo testee = new Foo(PERFORM_VALIDATION);\n\ninstead of:\n  Foo testee = new Foo(true);\n\nWrite DAMP Test Code\nAs we have seen, in order to highlight that a value is important to a test, we need to keep it within the test method that uses it. This may introduce duplication which we might not accept in normal code - but test code is a little different.\nCopy and paste coding is bad in tests as well as production code - the more code there is, the harder it is to read and a change to a concern will result in shotgun surgery if it has been duplicated throughout the tests.\nRepetition should therefore generally be avoided in test code.\nTest code is different from production code however.\nTest code must tell more of a story - highlighting what is important and hiding what is not. Test code should not be as DRY ( Don't Repeat Yourself ) as production code. It should be DAMP ( contain Descriptive And Meaningful Phrases ).\nIf refactoring a small amount of code out of a test method into a shared method hides what is happening, accept the duplication and leave it in place. If it does not affect readability then refactor mercilessly.\nChoose the Right Assertion Method\nWhen a test fails, a good assertion tells you what is wrong.\nAlthough JUnit allows you to supply an assertion message this adds noise to the test. Like comments, these messages should be saved for those occasions when you cannot communicate using code alone.\nBad\nassertTrue(\"Expected 2 but got \" + actual, actual == 2);\n\nGood\nassertEquals(2, actual);\n\nThe built in assertions are fairly limited. Alternative assertion libraries such as AssertJ provide richer functionality and result in more readable code.\n"},"tests/600_understand_how_to_use_mocks_and_stubs.html":{"url":"tests/600_understand_how_to_use_mocks_and_stubs.html","title":"Understand How To Use Mocks And Stubs","keywords":"","body":"Understand How to Use Mocks and Stubs\nThere are two sorts of code and they require two different sorts of test.\nWorker code does stuff. We can test worker code with state based testing - i.e. asserting that expected values are returned from methods, or objects are left in expected states.\nState based testing is easily recognized as it will use assert statements.\nManager code does stuff by co-coordinating others.\nManager code is harder to test than worker code because we need to make a choice - do we try to infer its behavior from its outputs using state based testing, or do we use interaction based testing?\nIn interaction based testing, we check that objects talk to each other in the expected fashion. To do this we need to somehow eavesdrop on the conversation. This is achieved by using objects that impersonate real ones.\nUsually these are created using a mocking framework.\nMocking Frameworks\nAlthough it is common to refer to all objects created by a mocking framework as mocks this is inaccurate.\nA more correct generic term for these objects is test double.\nThese can be subdivided based on how they behave:\n\nDummy object - needs to be present to satisfy a type signature but is never actually used\nStub - must be present and may supply indirect inputs\nMock - verifies that expected interactions take place\nFake - like a real thing but less heavy - e.g an in memory database\nSpy  - object that records its interactions with others\n\nOf these only stubs, mocks and spies might be created by a mocking framework.\nWe will talk about spies in a moment, but most test doubles can be conceptually viewed as being either a stub or a mock.\nThe important difference between them is that a mock has an expectation that will cause a test to fail if it is not met. i.e. if an expected method is not called on a mock the test will fail.\nA stub does not care if it is called or not - its role is simply to supply values.\nTraditional Mocks present a code readability dilemma. They define an expected outcome (a then), but are also part of the fixture required for the test to execute (a given).\nFor example with JMock we would write:\n  Mockery context = new Mockery();\n\n  // given / arrange\n  Subscriber subscriber = context.mock(Subscriber.class);\n  Publisher publisher = new Publisher();\n  publisher.add(subscriber);\n\n  final String message = \"message\";\n\n  // then / assert . . . but we haven't had a when yet\n  context.checking(new Expectations() {{\n    oneOf (subscriber).receive(message);\n  }});\n\n  // when / act\n  publisher.publish(message);\n\n  // then / assert\n  context.assertIsSatisfied();\n\nSpies solve this problem neatly.\nSpies\nSpies record their interactions with other objects.\nIn practice this means that Spies act as stubs by default, but as mocks when we want them to.\nThe given/when/then flow becomes easy and natural to maintain.\nFor example, using Mockito:\n  // given\n  Subscriber subscriber = Mockito.mock(Subscriber.class);\n  Publisher publisher = new Publisher();\n  publisher.add(subscriber);\n  String message = \"message\";\n\n  // when\n  publisher.publish(message);\n\n  // then\n  Mockito.verify(subscriber).receive(message);\n\nFor this reason we recommend using a spy framework.\nWhen spies act as mocks that must also supply indirect inputs, it is best to make them as forgiving as possible when supplying values but as specific as possible when verifying.\nWhat does this mean?\nLets imagine that, for some reason, the subscribers in our example had to return a positive integer in order for the code to execute without error. Perhaps there is some sort of assert statement in the code:\npublic interface Subscriber {\n  int receive(String message);\n}\n\nWe could ensure our test passed as follows:\n  String message = \"amessage\";\n  Subscriber subscriber = Mockito.mock(Subscriber.class);\n  // inject indirect value\n  Mockito.when(subscriber.receive(message)).thenReturn(1);\n\n  Publisher publisher = new Publisher();\n  publisher.add(subscriber);\n\n  publisher.publish(message);\n\n  Mockito.verify(subscriber).receive(message);\n\nWe will not discuss the Mockito API in any detail here, but this line:\n  Mockito.when(subscriber.receive(message)).thenReturn(1);\n\nEnsures that when the receive method is called on the spy with a string that equals the message variable, it will return 1.\nIf this line was not present the spy would do what Mockito does by default, which is to return 0.\nWhat would our test do if, due to a bug, receive was called with a different string?\nThe answer is that, instead of failing due to the verification:\n    Mockito.verify(subscriber).receive(message);\n\nIt would throw an error before it reached this point because the assertion in our production code would trigger.\nWe were too specific.\nIf we instead setup our spy as follows\n    Mockito.when(subscriber.receive(anyString())).thenReturn(1);\n\nThe test would fail cleanly.\nThis pattern of being lenient when supplying values, but specific when verifying also tends to result in tests that are less brittle when things change.\nStubs in State-Based Tests\nBy definition, state-based testing will never include mocks (in the strict sense of the word), but they may use stubs to supply indirect values.\nIt can be tempting to also use a mocking framework to stub values instead of using their constructors and modifier methods. For complex objects using stubs can appear easier than constructing real ones.\nDon't do this.\nMocking frameworks should be used only to isolate our tests from objects with behavior. If you have values that are difficult to construct consider the test data builder pattern instead\nChoosing Between State and Interaction Testing\nSometimes there is no choice about which to use. For example, it is not possible to meaningfully specify how a cache should behave from its inputs and outputs alone. Other times we must weigh the pros and cons.\nA state-based test for manager code is likely to be less easy to read and understand as it must rely on the behaviors of the objects the SUT interacts with. The test will also be coupled to these behaviors and will require changes if those behaviors change - you have effectively increased the size of the \"unit\" you are testing as discussed in \"Think units not methods\".\nInteraction-based testing requires us to peek beyond the unit's external interface and into its implementation. This carries the risk that we might over-specify and create an implementation-specific test.\nOn balance, it is preferable to lean towards state based testing and where possible enable it in the design of your code. There will, however, be many situations in which you will decide that interaction based testing is preferable.\n"},"tests/700_understand_your_options_for_code_reuse.html":{"url":"tests/700_understand_your_options_for_code_reuse.html","title":"Understand Your Options For Code Reuse","keywords":"","body":"Understand Your Options for Code Reuse\nReusing code is a good thing.\nWhen people start programming in an OO language for the first time they tend to over-use inheritance for this purpose before discovering that composition is generally a better idea.\nUnfortunately, it is not easy to use composition to reuse code in JUnit tests and this can lead you to write difficult-to-maintain test class hierarchies.\nA small amount of duplication may be preferable to introducing a class hierarchy when other options do not exist, but some types of test can be reused without inheritance.\nAssertions\nCode related to assertions is straightforward to reuse outside of class hierarchies.

Your tests should only produce errors when something unexpected has happened.\nHow Should I Test for Expected Exceptions?\nIt depends.\nThe built in:\n@Test(expected = FooException.class)\npublic void shouldThrowFooExceptionWhenFeelsLikeIt\n\nIs concise and suffices for simple scenarios, but has a gotcha. If the test method exercises more than one method of the testee, the expectation applies to the whole test method rather than the specific interaction with the testee that is expected to throw it.\nIf data held within the exception is important, it is also not possible to assert on it with this method.\nThe traditional solution is to use a try catch block:\n@Test\npublic void shouldThrowFooExceptionWhenFeelsLikeIt() {\n  try {\n    testee.doStuff();\n    fail(\"Expected an exception\");\n  } catch (FooException expectedException) {\n    assertThat(expectedException.getMessage(), is(\"felt like it\"));\n  }\n}\n\nThis is easy to follow, but a little verbose. It is also easy to forget to include the call to fail() if you are not test driving your code.\nJUnit now provides an alternate solution in the form of the 'ExpectedException' method rule. This allows for more fine grained exception checking:\n@Rule\npublic ExpectedException thrown= ExpectedException.none();\n\n@Test\npublic void foo() throws IOException {\n  thrown.expect(FooException.class);\n  thrown.expectMessage(\"felt like it\");\n\n  testee.doStuff();\n}\n\nThis is more concise, but breaks the usual given/when/then flow of a test by moving the then part to the start of the method.\nFor Java 8 AssertJ provides some custom assertions that can be used without breaking this flow.\n@Test\npublic void testException() {\n  assertThatThrownBy(() -> { testee.doStuff(); })\n   .isInstanceOf(Exception.class)\n   .hasMessageContaining(\"felt like it\");\n}\n\nAlthough it maintains the flow, the lambda in which the testee is called looks a little ugly.\nWhen it can be used we recommend sticking with the concise expected = format. For more complex situations it is largely a matter of taste.\nHow Do I Test an Abstract Class?\nAn abstract class is just a dependency that some other code will use - a dependency that you have made harder than usual to isolate due to your choice to make it an abstract class.\nSo first off, would your design look better if the functionality was being re-used by composition rather than inheritance?\nAssuming that you can't improve your design by getting rid of the abstract class you can either:\n\nTreat it as an implementation detail and check that each of its clients behaves as expected.\nTest it in isolation by creating an anonymous concrete class\n\nThe first approach will result in tests that are less tied to the implementation, but there will be repetition between the tests for each subclass.\nThe second approach will avoid repetition but is tied to the implementation and is likely to be brittle.\nHow Do I test Hashcode and Equals?\nTesting hashcode and equals can be fiddly and time consuming, which raises questions about whether it is time well spent given that the code is likely to have been auto-generated.\nEquals verifier project provides a good (partial) solution:\nhttp://www.jqno.nl/equalsverifier/\nIt checks that a class fulfills the hashcode-equals contract with a single line test that is trivial to write:\n  @Test\n  public void shouldObeyHashCodeEqualsContract() {\n    EqualsVerifier.forClass(MyValue.class).verify();\n  }\n\nIt does, however, do a very thorough job of checking the contract - including how it interacts with inheritance. It is non-trivial to make a non-final class conform to the contract.\nAlthough equals verifier does a good job of checking the hashcode equals contract, it has no knowledge of how you expect the methods to actually behave. If you wish equality to (for example) be defined by a single ID field only, you must write additional tests that verify this behavior.\nFor the common scenario of a class that should be considered equal based on all of its fields the behavior may be checked in a single test:\n  @Test\n  public void shouldObeyHashCodeEqualsContract() {\n    EqualsVerifier.forClass(MyValue.class).allFieldsShouldBeUsed().verify();\n  }\n\nThis may become the default behavior in a future version of EqualsVerifier, but must be specifically specified in 1.7.5\n"},"badadvice.html":{"url":"badadvice.html","title":"Bad advice","keywords":"","body":"Bad Advice\nSome truly terrible ideas are commonly circulated as \"best practice\". In this section we provide examples and explain why they should be ignored.\n"},"badadvice/100_single_exit_point_rules.html":{"url":"badadvice/100_single_exit_point_rules.html","title":"Single Exit Point Rules","keywords":"","body":"Bad Advice - Single Exit Point Rules\nSome coding standards mandate that all methods should have a single exit point.\nDoing so can be damaging, particularly when it is enforced by static analysis.\nDetails\nSingle exit point is an idea with a long history dating back to the era of liberally applied gotos and spaghetti code.\nIn that context, adding constraints on what could happen within a function was helpful. Knowing that there is only one point that a large function can exit from makes it easier to understand.\nMany modern functional languages continue to either enforce or encourage single exit points.\nSo it must be a good idea to add this constraint to Java right?\nLets look what happens when we are told we must only have one exit point:\nSingle exit with statements\npublic class Example {\n  private int value;\n\n  public int single(int x) {\n    int retVal = 0;\n\n    if (x == 10) {\n      retVal = -value;\n    } else if (x > 0) {\n      retVal = value + x;\n    }\n\n    return retVal;\n  }\n\n}\n\nIf we remove the single exit point constraint we get:\nMultiple exit\npublic class Example {\n  private int value;\n\n  public int multi(int x) {\n    if (x == 10) {\n      return -value;\n    }\n\n    if (x > 0) {\n      return value + x;\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n  }\n}\n\nWhich version is better?\nThere isn't much in it, but the multiple exit point version is easier to comprehend.\nTrying to apply the single exit point constraint resulted in an additional local variable to hold return state. In the multi exit version we can clearly see what is returned when none of the conditions match. In the single exit version it is slightly less clear as the returned value is declared at the start of the method then overwritten.\nSo does this mean that single exit point methods are bad?\nNo.\nIt is possible to write alternate single exit implementations.\n  public int oneAssignment(int x) {\n    final int retVal;\n\n    if (x == 10) {\n      retVal = -value;\n    } else if (x > 0) {\n      retVal = value + x;\n    } else {\n      retVal = 0;\n    }\n\n    return retVal;\n  }\n\nWe've addressed the issues we identified earlier. We only assign to retVal once and it is clear what is assigned when none of the conditions match.\nIs this superior in some way to the multi exit version?\nNot really.\nWe can also write a single exit method using the ? operator:\nSingle exit with the ? operator\n  public int expression(int x) {\n    return  x ==  10 ? -value\n        : x > 0  ? value + x\n        : 0;\n  }\n\nWe have switched from using a statement (if) to working with expressions (i.e. things that return a value). This allows us to get rid of the additional variable while maintaining a single exit point.\nIs this version clearer than the multi-exit version? That is debatable and ultimately a matter of personal taste.\nThe code using ?  is terse and some will find it harder to understand.\nThe multi-exit version is more verbose but its proponents would argue it is easier to comprehend.\nIf your personal preference is for the ? operator version, it still does not follow that the single exit point rule is something you should try to universally apply.\nThe most likely result is that you will push people towards writing code like the earlier bloated version of our method. As Java is a largely statement-based language, you will also encounter logic where the multi-exit version is undeniably clearer.\nMartin Fowler and Kent Beck express things nicely in \"Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code\"\n\n\". . . one exit point is really not a useful rule. Clarity is the key principle: If the method is clearer with one exit point, use one exit point; otherwise don't\"\n\nThere is nothing wrong with single exit functions, but only write them when it makes sense to do so.\n"},"badadvice/200_always_use_a_StringBuffer.html":{"url":"badadvice/200_always_use_a_StringBuffer.html","title":"Always Use A StringBuffer","keywords":"","body":"Bad Advice - Always Use a StringBuffer to Concatenate\nThis advice is doubly wrong.\nFirstly it advocates using the synchronized StringBuffer rather than a StringBuilder.\nSecondly it is an oversimplification or misunderstanding of the more nuanced and reasonable advice to not concatenate Strings in a loop.\nAvoiding concatenation in a loop is reasonable. Using a StringBuilder is likely to be more efficient if the loop executes a reasonable number of times as it will avoid string allocations.\nThe performance difference is unlikely to be significant in most cases, but the resulting code isn't noticeably less-readable - so it is a premature optimization without a cost.\nLets see what happens when we apply this advice when no loop is present:\n  public String buffer(String s, int i) {\n    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();\n    sb.append(\"Foo\");\n    sb.append(s);\n    sb.append(i);\n    return sb.toString();\n  }\n\n  public String concat(String s, int i) {\n    return \"Foo\" + s + i;\n  }\n\nThe concat version is far clearer.\nIs it less efficient?\nThe eclipse compiler generates the following bytecode for concat:\n    NEW java/lang/StringBuilder\n    DUP\n    LDC \"Foo\"\n    INVOKESPECIAL java/lang/StringBuilder.

Although compilers may exist that do not support this optimization it is unlikely that you will ever use them.\n"},"badadvice/300_hungarian_notation.html":{"url":"badadvice/300_hungarian_notation.html","title":"Hungarian Notation","keywords":"","body":"Bad Advice - Hungarian Notation\nThe idea of Hungarian notation and similar schemes is to reflect the type, scope or other attribute of a variable in its name.\nFor example:\n\nbFlag\nnSize\nm_nSize\n\nWhere b indicates a Boolean type, n an integer type and m_ that the named variable is a field.\nThis is a terrible idea.\nSuch notation might be useful if you are reading code printed to paper, but all the information it provides is readily available in a modern IDE.\nNaming things is hard enough without adding additional concerns that the name must handle.\nThese types of notation are like comments.

If extra effort is not spent to maintain them they become misleading.\nUncle Bob Martin puts it nicely:\n\n\"nowadays, HN and other forms of type encoding are simply impediments.
